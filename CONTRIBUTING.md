Bug Reports
===========

If you've found a bug in LinkKit itself, then please file a new issue here at GitHub. If you
have found a bug in a Link-enabled app, it might be wiser to reach out to the developer of
the app before filing an issue here.

Any and all information that you can provide regarding the bug will help in our being able
to find it. Specifically, that could include:

 - Stacktraces, in the event of a crash
 - Versions of the software used, and the underlying operating system
 - Steps to reproduce
 - Screenshots, in the case of a bug which results in a visual error
